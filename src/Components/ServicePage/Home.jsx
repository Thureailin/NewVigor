                <p>The Galaxy S23 Ultra comes with a base storage of 256GB instead of the standard 128GB. This is helpful if you plan to carry your phone for a long time and click a lot of photos, shoot 8K videos, and download movies and graphics-intensive games. Just to be clear, 128GB is enough for most people, but on a phone that is designed for media consumption and heavy use, it's certainly not enough. So, it's a good decision to provide 256GB of storage on the base model and 1TB on the maxed-out one.</p>
